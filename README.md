### Tournaments Coverage

To guarantee the highest data quality and consistency, Padel API currently focuses on the following tournament levels.

This ensures comprehensive and timely coverage of draws, schedules, matches, results, and statistics.

Feature availability varies by tournament level. Refer to the tables below for the current availability of Results, Stats, and Live coverage.

#### Padel FIP & Premier Padel

Lower-tier events (such as FIP Rise, FIP Promises, national or exhibition events, and qualifiers) may have incomplete or inconsistent data at the source, so we cannot guarantee the same quality.

#### World Padel Tour

Coverage currently includes 2023 World Padel Tour events. Additional historical data is being collected and will be added as it meets quality standards.

### Authentication

The **Padel API** uses API tokens to authenticate requests. These are provided to you on your [API Tokens](https://padelapi.org/user/api-tokens) management page.

To authenticate, you need to include an `Authorization` header in all of your requests. In this header, you must state that you're using an API token (similar to [HTTP basic access authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication)).

For example:

```curl
curl -i -X GET \
  'https://padelapi.org/api/seasons' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN_HERE'
```

Either if the API key isn't valid, or you don't provide an `Authorization` header at all, you'll receive a `401` status code as response

### Pagination

Several endpoints return paginated results.

By default, the **Padel API** only returns the first 15 results for those endpoints. You can use optional query parameters to increase or decrease the number of results.

| Parameter  | Description                                                         |
|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `per_page` | Number of results to return per page (default: 15, min: 1, max: 50) |
| `page`     | Page number to retrieve                                             |

### Status Codes

The **Padel API** uses conventional [HTTP response codes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status) to indicate whether a request was successful (`2XX` codes) or resulted in an error (`4XX` and `5XX` codes).

### Padel API MCP Server

The Padel API MCP Server allows AI tools like Chat GPT, Claude Desktop, and others to seamlessly access live Padel API context and tools—like search players, tournaments, matches and statistics. You don't need to install or run anything. Just paste the server URL into your remote MCP-compatible host, authenticate, and you're ready to go.

#### 🔍 What is the Padel API MCP Server?

The Padel API MCP Server surfaces Padel API context and functionality to any AI host that supports the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction?utm_campaign=mpu_july2025&utm_medium=email&utm_source=github). It lets tools like GitHub Copilot query and operate on Padel API data securely and in real time, enabling more context-aware and actionable agent workflows across environments.
