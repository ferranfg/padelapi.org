**Hello developers,**

We've been working hard to bring more flexibility, data, and usability to the Padel API in the last few months. Here's what's new:

## 1. New Pro Plan (49€/month)

We've introduced a new plan designed for developers and businesses that need access to all API features but with lower request consumption.

It includes all professional features, ideal for small projects, startups, or early-stage integrations.

## 2. New domain: padelapi.org

Padel API has been **spun off from Fantasy Padel Tour** and now runs independently under [padelapi.org](https://padelapi.org).

Your existing integrations will continue to work with the fantasypadeltour.com domain, but we recommend updating to the new domain for future compatibility.

## 3. Padel API Explorer

You can now **explore all Padel API data directly from your browser**. No code required.

Browse tournaments, matches, players, and even inspect your own API logs in a user-friendly interface.

## 4. Low-tier tournaments are coming

After successfully integrating **FIP Platinum** tournaments, we're now preparing to include **FIP Gold, Silver, and Bronze** events.

This will expand data coverage beyond Premier Padel and offer deeper insight into the professional and semi-professional circuit.
